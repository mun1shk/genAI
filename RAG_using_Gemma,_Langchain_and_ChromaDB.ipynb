        "What is RAG?\n",
        "\n",
        "Retriever augmented generation (RAG) is a system that improves the response generated by a LLM in two ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "    First, the information is retrieved from a dataset that is stored in vector database; the query is used to perform similarity search in the documents stored in the vector database.\n",
        "    Second, by restraining the context provided to the LLM to content that is similar with the initial query, stored in the vector database, we can reduce significantly (or even eliminate) LLM's halucinations, since the answer is provided from the context of the stored documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "An important advantage of this approach is that we do not need to fine-tune the LLM with our custom data; instead, the data is ingested (cleaned, transformed, chunked, and indexed in the vector database).\n",
        "Procedure\n",
        "\n",
        "We create two classes:\n",
        "\n",
        "    AIAgent - An AI Agent that query Gemma LLM using a custom prompt that instruct Gemma to generate and answer (from the query) by refering to the context (as well provided); the answer to the AI Agent query function is then returned.\n",
        "    RAGSystem - initialized with the dataset with Data Science information, with an AIAgent object. In the init function of this class, we ingest the data from the dataset in the vector database. This class have as well a query member function. In this function we first perform similarity search with the query to the vector database. Then, we call the generate function of the ai agent object. Before returning the answer, we use a predefined template to compose the overal response from the question, answer and the context retrieved.\n"

It is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks.\n\n**Key Concepts of SVM:**\n\n* **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** These are hyperplanes in a high-dimensional space that best separate the different classes of data.\n* **Kernels:** These are functions that determine the distance between data points in the feature space. Different kernels can be used to define the distance metric.\n* **Cost Function:** This is a penalty term that is added to the loss function to encourage the SVM to find a hyperplane that is as far from the data points as possible.\n* **Optimization Algorithm:** This algorithm is used to find the optimal hyperplane that minimizes the cost function.\n\n**How SVMs Work:**\n\n1. **Data Preparation:** The data is first transformed into a high-dimensional feature space using a kernel function.\n2. **Finding the Hyperplane:** An SVM is found by solving a linear optimization problem. The goal is to find the hyperplane that best separates the data points into different classes.\n3. **Classification:** New data points are then classified by checking which side of the hyperplane they fall on.\n\n**Advantages of SVMs:**\n\n* High accuracy\n* Robust to noise and outliers\n* Can be used for both classification and regression\n\n**Disadvantages of SVMs:**\n\n* Can be sensitive to the choice of kernel function\n* Not suitable for high-dimensional data\n* Can be computationally expensive to train\n\n**Applications of SVMs:**\n\n* Credit card fraud detection\n* Medical diagnosis\n* Image recognition\n* Natural language processing\n\n**<font color='green'>Context:</font>**\n[Document(page_content='question: What’s singular value decomposition?

Labeled data indicates that the\\xa0input data has already been tagged with the appropriate output. Basically, it is the task of learning a function that maps the input set and returns an output.
